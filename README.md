# Drag and Drop Puzzle Game - Lucas Beatty

This is a drag and drop puzzle game That I've been experimenting with. It's going to be able to to have the puzzle piece be clicked and dragged into placed in the right area and reset when a new layout or puzzle is changed too.

## Getting Started
In class, we created the foundation of the game. However, the game still had a lot of bugs to sort through to make it run properly. I'm going to spend some time on getting them to work fully and adding in a reset just for an overall better game!

There will four peaces on the side of the main puzzle area, clicking and dragging from the left to the right should have the peaces snap into place and keep them there and allow the puzzle to be completed. In total there will be 4 puzzles to complete with there own reset so you don't have to reload the page.

## Install
Clicking the green bar and cloning it to your computer is all you need! its that easy, give it a try and get matching.

## Built With
Sublime Text - creating the html, CSS and JS necessary to create the page.
